Nodecoin build instructions for Windows
=======================================
Instructions for building under MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows).
The code should also build with some minor changes under other environments 
such as Visual C++.

Windows network coding tips are here:

=============
Install MinGW
=============
http://www.mingw.org/

MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a minimalist 
development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

MinGW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is 
suitable for the development of native MS-Windows applications, and 
which do not depend on any 3rd-party C-Runtime DLLs. 

MinGW includes:

    A port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), including C, C++, ...
    GNU Binutils for Windows (assembler, linker, archive manager)
    A command-line installer (mingw-get) for MinGW and MSYS deployment on MS-Windows
    A GUI wrapper (mingw-get-inst) for the command line installer

MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system. 

==============
Download MinGW 
==============
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

Thus, we strongly recommend that you do not install MinGW in any location
with spaces in the path name reference. You should avoid installing into
any directory or subdirectory having names like "Program Files" or
"My Documents", etc.

An automated GUI installer assistant called mingw-get-setup.exe is the 
preferred method for first time installation. 

* Download mingw-get-setup.exe

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download

* Run mingw-get-setup.exe

Choose installation dir: C:\MinGW

In MinGW Installation Manager, click the following checkboxes and select 
"Mark for Installation" for each one.

[X] mingw32-developer-tools
[X] mingw32-base
[X] mingw32-gcc-g++
[X] msys-base

Go to the menu bar and select "Installation" > "Apply changes" then click "Apply"

Close the MinGW Installation Manager window.

=======================
MinGW Post Installation 
=======================
Regardless of how you installed MinGW and/or MSYS, if yo did choose to install 
MSYS, you should check its configuration. You need to ensure that MSYS knows 
where MinGW is located, so:

    Open a Windows Explorer window and locate your installation directory 
    (i.e. C:\MinGW, or any alternative you nominated during installation).
    Below your installation directory, you should find a directory named 
    "msys", (normally in lower case letters, but mixed case, or all upper 
    case is okay too); open this then find and open the additional 
    subdirectories, "1.0" and "etc".
    
    Within the "etc" directory, there should be a file named "fstab"; 
    (if not, create one, as a new text file). Open this with a text editor; 
    (you should be able to do this by right clicking on it, and in the popup 
    menu select "Open" or "Open With", although you may find that you need 
    to select a suitable editor application to do so).
    Edit the file and ensure that it contains one line, (there may be others), 
    which reads:

    C:\MinGW   /mingw

    (substituting the FULL ABSOLUTE path of any alternative to C:\MinGW, 
    which you nominated during installation); ensure that you follow this 
    path name entry with at least one space, or tab, before typing the 
    "/mingw" entry.
    
The preferred installation target directory is C:\MinGW

Before you save the file, ensure that there is at least one blank line at 
the bottom, below all of the entries that may exist, then save and close 
the file.

========================== 
Run the postinstall script
==========================
From the windows explorer, navigate to msys\1.0\postinstall
Run the postinstall script.

	pi.bat

Run msys.bat to get a bash-like prompt.

===========================
MinGW disk error workaround
===========================
Launch the msys shell and run the df command at the prompt.

	$ df
	
If you get an error/warning listing missing drives like /d, /e, then you 
may want to look into the following. 

If you run gcc and other programs, annoying warnings will pop up and you'll 
want to fix it:

- Disabled my card reader at drive E:
- Inserted a dvd at drive D:
- Quit out of mysys, and relaunched msys window
- "df" command works without an error

============
Install CURL 
============
http://mingw.5.n7.nabble.com/Easiest-way-for-users-to-install-Curl-for-MinGW-td31434.html

From your Windows browser, download curl-7.35.0.tar.gz from 

	http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

Save the download curl-7.35.0.tar.gz to inside your MinGW home directory, 
such as:

	C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\YourUserName

Now when you run msys, you should see the download when you type ls.

	$ ls -l 
	curl-7.35.0.tar.gz
	
Unpack the archive and build

	$ tar -zxvf curl-7.35.0.tar.gz
	$ cd curl-7.35.0
	$ ./configure --prefix=/mingw
	$ make
	$ make install

Library files are installed to C:\MinGW\lib which is mapped to /mingw/lib 
in the msys shell.

===================================
Building nodeminer and get_dogeaddr 
===================================
### Build windows executables on a MinGW platform.
### Requires curl library to have been built already.
### Executables may require libcurl-4.dll to be in directory.
### See build-windows.txt for instructions.

rm -fv get_dogeaddr.o get_dogeaddr.exe nodeminer.o nodeminer.exe

gcc -static-libgcc -c get_dogeaddr.c
gcc -static-libgcc get_dogeaddr.o -o get_dogeaddr.exe -lwsock32 -lws2_32 -lcurl

gcc -static-libgcc -c nodeminer.c
gcc -static-libgcc nodeminer.o -o nodeminer.exe -lwsock32 -lws2_32 -lcurl

======================================
Note: on linking to libraries and dlls 
======================================
If applications use CURL and link dynamically to curl, then a curl dll will 
need to included with the built application, for example executables may 
require libcurl-4.dll to be in the directory.
